    <p>Hello there, My name is Noah Petrovski. I am a current senior at Michigan State Univeristy and love all things rock. My guitar journey began in 2020 during the pandemic. I was so bored at home that I decided to buy a Rockband video game set for me and my family to play with while in lockdown. I eventually got so good at the game *and really loved the music* that I eventually decided that I wanted to learn how to play the real thing. For 6 months, I studied and learned guitar through videos and articles online. Chirstmas 2020 I finally got my first guitar: a black Squire stratocaster. I was hooked. All I did was play the damn thing. The one thing no one will tell you outside of the guitar community is once you get that first taste of gear, its over. All I wanted to do was improve my technique and sound. With that came the mass buying of guitars and rigs lol. I now have 6 guitars and a countless amount of pedals/amps. If you are interested in playing guitar, I always say to go for it. All it takes is some time and drive and you can accomplish your goal, whether thats learning guitar or anthing else!</p>
