      <p>If you have ever hung out with a group of music heads or flipped through classic rock radio, you have probably stumbled into this debate: Whats the best rock album of all time? And let me tell you theres no right answer, but its a fun fight to have. Some people swear by Dark Side of the Moon from Pink Floyd. Its hard to argue against it. The production, the concept, the timeless feel. But then you have got Led Zeppelin IV, which gave us Stairway to Heaven, one of the most iconic rock songs ever written. Then again, if we are talking raw energy and rebellion, Nevermind by Nirvana completely flipped the game and defined an entire generation. Can you even talk rock albums without mentioning Abbey Road or The White Album from The Beatles? Personally I go back and forth. One day its Back in Black, the next day its The Wall. Theres just something about these records that hit different depending on where you are in life. Some are technically perfect, some are emotionally untouchable. Thats the beauty of music. So no, I dont have an answer. And honestly, I hope I never settle on one. The best rock album of all time isnt one album. Its every album that ever made you stop, turn it up, and lose yourself in the sound.</p>

      <h2>Why Rock is NOT Dead</h2>

      <p>Every few months someone tweets or says Rock is dead, and every time I see it, I laugh. Have you been outside lately? Rock is NOT dead, you just stopped looking for it. Yeah, sure, mainstream charts are packed with pop and hip hop. But rocks not gone, it just lives in a different space now. Its in the dive bars, in the bedroom studios, in the indie labels, in the festivals that sell out without a single radio hit. Bands like Turnstile, Greta Van Fleet, Foo Fighters *still killing it*, and even newcomers like Wet Leg or Maneskin are proving that the genres alive and well, just not always on your TikTok For You page. Thats what makes it so awesome. I think people miss the feeling of rock. That dirty, loud, in-your-face attitude. But guess what? Its still there. You just have to turn off the algorithm and dig a little deeper. If you have ever been to a local show, felt the floor shake, or lost your voice screaming the lyrics of your favorite band, you know. Rock is not dead. Its just not trying to be famous. Its trying to be real. And honestly, thats more rock and roll than anything.</p>
